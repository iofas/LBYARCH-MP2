## Execution Time and Analysis
### Average Execution Time in Seconds (After 30 Runs)
| Vector Size | C Kernel | x86-64 Kernel | Speedup (x86-64 / C)
|--|--|--|--|
| 2<sup>20</sup> | 0.002167 | 0.000567 | 3.82x |
| 2<sup>24</sup> | 0.029367 | 0.012267 | 2.39x |
| 2<sup>28</sup> | 0.475200 | 0.205500 | 2.31x |
### Analysis
The `Speedup (x86-64 / C)` column refers to the rate that the x86-64 kernel is faster than the C kernel. From this we can conclude that the x86-64 kernel runs significantly faster than the C kernel.
